    "## Model Overview\n",
    "SA-OT (Simulated Annealing for Optimality Theory) extends classical Optimality Theory (OT) -- a model of linguistic competence -- by integrating a stochastic search algorithm that models linguistic performance. \n",
    "As such, it relies on the basic components of standard OT:\n",
    "- a **candidate set** of linguistic forms, and\n",
    "- a set of **constraints**, ranked into **hierarchies** that represent different grammars.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, it introduces two new elements that allows modeling performance variation:\n",
    "- a **neighborhood structure (topology)** that organizes the candidate set by structural similarity, and\n",
    "- a **search algorithm** -- specifically, simulated annealing -- that performs a random walk through this candidate space, guided by a harmony function derived from the constraint hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the search is stochastic, SA-OT does not always find the globally optimal candidate, i.e., the grammartical form. Instead, it might settle on local optima -- suboptimal outputs, e.g., errors arising from fast speech, slips of the tongue, or tolerable irregularities. This is how SA-OT models linguistic performance, not just idealized grammatical competence thus accounts for linguistic variation and change. "

It consists in a **random walk** over the topology, starting from one candidate and exploring its neighbors.
